# Use permalinks to dislay code snippets in Github Issues

Github supports embedding code snippets in Github issues by using the permalink URL.

Copy the permalink from a file and paste it into an issue.

<img src="copy-permalink.html" />

This renders a nice code snippet in the issue:



This only seems to work for permalinks from the same repo as the issue.
