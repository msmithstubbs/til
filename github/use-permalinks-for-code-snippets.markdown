# Use permalinks to dislay code snippets in Github Issues

Github supports embedding code snippets in Github issues by using the permalink URL.

Copy the permalink from a file and paste it into an issue.

This renders a nice code snippet in the issue:

This only seems to work for permalinks from the same repo as the issue.
